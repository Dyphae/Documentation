# Welcome!
Dyphae is a powerful but easy to use framework for making Minecraft datapacks in Java
<br>

## Why use a framework?
You may be wondering why you should use a framework instead of simply coding a datapack, well using any datapack framework, not just **Dyphae**, means that you don't have to setup all those annoying base files for a datapack, and you can take advantage of the programming language the framework uses (**Java** in this case) to speed up the development process (automaticly generating lots of files, etc.)

## Why shouldn't I just use another framework?
Dyphae only requires you to have at least a very small amount of knowledge with coding in Java. But if you don't know Java and are fimiliar with other languages such as Python, Typescript/Javascript, or Dart there are plently of other frameworks for you to choose from (eg. [Sandstone](https://www.sandstone.dev/), [ObjD](https://objd.stevertus.com/), [Beet](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet)) and I highly encourage you to check them out, **the important thing is that you find a framework that is right for you**

## Why did you choose Java?
I chose to use Java for Dyphae for a few reasons:
1. I really like Java and have been using it for all of my projects
2. One day I was messing around with [ObjD](https://objd.stevertus.com/) and realised that there were no datapack frameworks that use the very language Minecraft is made in
3. *haha Java go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*
